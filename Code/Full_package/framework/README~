For runMethods.py, split_and_classify.py, classification_methods_function.py


Steps for running classification methods iteratively.
1) runMethods.py loads a csv file and preprocess the data. Calls split_and_classify() from split_and_classify.py
2) split_and_classify.py main function, split_and_classify() splits the data intro training and testing for all features,
   and for top mRMR features. Calls classification_methods() from classification_methods_function.py
3) classification_methods_function.py runs the 9 classifiers and saves the output in an array.

To run runMethods.py:
-Modify line 12 with csv file name 
-mRMR features are in line 10. Modify if needed. 

Note: 
printed names of columns at the end are for mRMR. 
This function was tested with a csv file with the format [GROUP_ID, features, labels].
If mRMR did NOT accout for the first column, add 1 to the indices. (default)
If mRMR did account for the first column, do not add 1. (change this in runMethods.py, line 166).
